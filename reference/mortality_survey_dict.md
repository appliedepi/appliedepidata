## Details

This is a fake data dictionary for the
[mortality_survey_data](https://appliedepi.github.io/appliedepidata/reference/mortality_survey_data.md)
dataset. This data dictionary was originally in ODK excel format and
using functions from
[epidict](https://r4epi.github.io/epidict/index.html) was transformed in
to long format, so that it can be used for recoding using the
[matchmaker](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/matchmaker/) package.
Please note, that this data is entirely fictional created based on the
Doctors without Borders (MSF) ethical review board pre-approved survey
dictionaries. They have been generated here exclusively for training
purposes.
