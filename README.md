# appliedepidata

This package stores all Applied Epi data across books, courses and tutorials

## stuff to consider

- function/script to create a data dictionary for a dataset which can then be used to fill in the man files for each dataset in the package and link to a dataset
- {epirhandbook} has non-R datasets
- naming of datasets
- versioning of datasets (and edits thereof, e.g. same data for diff bits of course)
- language suffixes
- table for readme/pkgdown listing datasets, versions, languages, source, and where used (e.g. case study, course, tutorial, epirhandbook)
- how to handle data dictionaries/codebooks?
- downloading functions
- unit testing of functions
- messy datasets a la [{medicaldata}](https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/?tab=readme-ov-file#messy-datasets)
